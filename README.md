# Prework-CodeChallenges
A repo for the prework code challenges

I have read both articles and listened to the podcast but I have no idea how to do any of the code challenges. I am going to work on the code/lab stuff now, but no way will I finish before 11:59 so just getting something turned in before it is late. On that, it doesn't make much sense to me to have something due at 11:59 pm on one day that requires doing something due at 2 pm the next day. Why not have them reversed?
